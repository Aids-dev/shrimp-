Cracked from aids.dev it is very good tried it ourselves it is a loader so we had to make it into a .exe run it and it should open a loader in 30 seconds to a min
it will set off windows defender it's a false alarm it doesn't do anything it's like rushercrack it is a false trojan you can download it if you wish or you don't have to download it it's up to you
if you have any questions or issues make a issue in this 
Will try and make it a .jar soon
